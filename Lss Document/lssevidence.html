    <h1>Lss and Friends Page</h1>
    <p class="centered">
        <span class="highlight">@TransphobicLss</span>, or as we will call it <span class="highlight">Lss</span>, 
        is an account made by Dan to expose the moderators on TransphobicLs. Despite its seemingly good intentions, 
        the creator and past moderators of the account have proven to be <span class="danger">vindictive</span> and 
        have their own <span class="danger">skeletons in the closet</span>.
    </p>
    <img src="images/image167.png" alt="Lss profile image">
    <p>
        The account originated in <span class="highlight">November of 2022</span> amidst the controversy of a 
        <span class="danger">zoophile</span> being on the mod team of TransphobicLs. Claiming to be there to document 
        and uplift victims‚Äô voices, it was revealed that the true purpose of the account was to 
        <span class="danger">circumvent the truce between Dan and Zrcalo</span>.
    </p>
    <img src="images/image160.png" alt="Evidence screenshot">
    <p>
        This account and the drama surrounding it spiraled into a pillar of <span class="danger">lies</span>, 
        <span class="danger">deception</span>, <span class="danger">abuse</span>, and 
        <span class="danger">child endangerment</span>. Multiple moderators of Lss were manipulated and have since 
        denounced the account and the people behind it, calling it a <span class="danger">vengeful plot</span> that 
        cannot be trusted due to constant "<span class="highlight">bold-faced lies</span>" for the sake of 
        "<span class="highlight">the message</span>".
    </p>

    <!-- Background Section -->
    <h1>Background</h1>
    <p>
        The account was created on <span class="highlight">November 3, 2023</span>, by Dan (ü¶ê mod), who shortly after 
        recruited <span class="danger">Oliver</span> as the web (üï∏Ô∏è) mod of the account. The day after, 
        <span class="highlight">JesterKitty</span> (who was <span class="danger">16 years old</span>) was recruited 
        as the tennis (üéæ) mod, and the day after that, Paul was brought on board as the virus (ü¶†) mod.
